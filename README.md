## Introduction


"Folders is a language where the program is encoded into a directory structure. All files within are ignored, as are the names of the folders. Commands and expressions are encoded by the pattern of folders within folders. "
Folders was created by Daniel Temkin https://danieltemkin.com/Esolangs/Folders/

This is an example of a "Hello World"-program:
